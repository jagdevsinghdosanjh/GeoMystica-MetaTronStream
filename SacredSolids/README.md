# 🔷 SacredSolids: Platonic Geometry Explorer

**SacredSolids** is an interactive, symbolic learning platform that blends mathematics, geometry, and ancient wisdom into a modular 3D experience. Built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Three.js, it invites users to explore the Platonic solids not just as shapes — but as archetypes of elemental meaning.

---

## 🌌 Features

- 🧱 **3D Viewer**: Explore Platonic solids in real-time using Three.js
- 📊 **Plotly Visualizations**: View geometric structures with labeled vertices and faces
- 🔣 **Symbolic Descriptions**: Euler’s formula and elemental symbolism for each solid
- 🎨 **Custom Styling**: Thematic overlays and sacred color palettes
- 🧠 **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of geometry, symbolism, and UI components

🧠 Philosophy
SacredSolids is more than a geometry viewer — it's a symbolic bridge between ancient mathematical insight and modern interactive design. Each solid is rendered not just with vertices and edges, but with meaning: elemental forces, mythic archetypes, and cosmic resonance.
